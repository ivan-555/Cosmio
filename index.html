            <h1>Solar System</h1>
            <p>
                The solar system is a collection of celestial bodies bound by the gravitational pull of the Sun,
                which sits at its center. It consists of eight planets, moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets,
                and various other objects, all orbiting the Sun. The planets are divided into two main groups: the
                terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—and the gas giants—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
                and Neptune. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and
                dust, called a solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, most of the material
                collected in the center to form the Sun, while the rest flattened into a disk, where planets and
                other objects gradually formed. <br> <br>
                The Sun, the central star, provides the energy necessary
                for life on Earth. It is mainly composed of hydrogen, which undergoes nuclear fusion to create helium,
                producing the light and heat that sustain the solar system. <br> <br>
                The inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth,
                and Mars, are rocky and have solid surfaces. Earth is the only known planet to harbor life, thanks to
                its liquid water, protective atmosphere, and moderate climate. <br> <br>
                The outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are gas giants (with the exception of Neptune and Uranus, which are often
                categorized as ice giants). These planets are much larger than the inner planets and consist mostly
                of hydrogen, helium, and other gases <br><br>
                The solar system also contains the asteroid belt,
                located between Mars and Jupiter. This region is filled with rocky objects that never coalesced into
                a planet, likely due to Jupiter’s strong gravity. <br><br>
                Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region of
                icy objects, including dwarf planets like Pluto. <br><br>
                Farther still, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a
                vast, spherical region of comets surrounding the solar system. <br><br>
                The planets follow elliptical
                orbits around the Sun, and their distance from the Sun determines the length of their year.
                While the solar system is vast, the Sun’s influence extends well beyond the orbits of Neptune
                and Pluto, defining the heliosphere, the boundary where the solar wind gives way to interstellar space​.
                Scientists continue to explore the solar system using space probes and telescopes,
                uncovering new details about its formation, evolution, and the potential for life beyond Earth.

            <h1>Sun</h1>
            <p>
                The Sun is the central star of our solar system and provides the energy necessary for life on Earth.
                With a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers, it contains 99.8% of the solar system's total mass.
                The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%), which it fuses into helium
                through nuclear fusion in its core, producing vast amounts of energy. This process releases the light
                and heat that reach Earth, driving weather systems and supporting life through photosynthesis. The surface
                temperature of the Sun reaches approximately 5,500°C, while its core burns at an incredible 15 million°C.
                The Sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle, during which its magnetic activity rises and falls, affecting
                solar winds, sunspots, and solar flares, which can influence Earth's atmosphere and technology. The Sun's
                gravity holds the planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit around it, making it the dominant gravitational
                force in the solar system. Over billions of years, the Sun will continue to evolve, eventually expanding
                into a red giant and later shedding its outer layers, leaving behind a white dwarf.

            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>
                Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880
                kilometers. It has no significant atmosphere, which means it cannot retain heat, leading to extreme
                temperature variations. Daytime temperatures can soar to 430°C, while nighttime temperatures can
                plunge to -180°C due to the lack of atmospheric insulation. Mercury's surface is heavily cratered,
                much like the Moon, as it has been bombarded by meteoroids and comets over billions of years.
                The planet's proximity to the Sun means it has very short years, taking only 88 Earth days to
                complete an orbit. However, it rotates very slowly, taking 59 Earth days to rotate once on its
                axis, which contributes to its extreme temperature fluctuations. Despite its hostile environment,
                recent findings suggest that Mercury may have water ice in permanently shadowed craters at its poles,
                where sunlight never reaches, keeping temperatures low enough for ice to persist. This discovery has
                intrigued scientists, as it opens up new questions about the planet's past.

            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>
                Venus, similar in size to Earth, has a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers but a thick,
                toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (about 96.5%) and clouds of sulfuric acid. This
                dense atmosphere traps heat through a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in
                the solar system, with surface temperatures exceeding 460°C (860°F), even hotter than Mercury, despite
                being farther from the Sun. Scientists have long speculated that Venus might have once been more
                Earth-like, with liquid water on its surface and possibly even conditions suitable for life.
                There is evidence that Venus may have had oceans for up to 3 billion years, which raises the
                question of whether it could have supported microbial life in the distant past. However, over
                time, volcanic activity and a buildup of greenhouse gases likely led to the runaway greenhouse
                effect, which transformed Venus into the incredibly hostile environment it is today. The planet’s
                thick carbon dioxide atmosphere traps heat, while sulfuric acid clouds contribute to its toxic
                conditions. This extreme climate makes Venus an essential subject of study for understanding
                climate change and how Earth’s own atmosphere could evolve under certain conditions.One of Venus'
                unique features is its retrograde rotation, meaning it rotates in the opposite direction to most
                other planets. It takes about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, making its day longer than
                its year, which lasts about 225 Earth days. Additionally, Venus has no moons and exhibits phases
                similar to the Moon when observed from Earth due to its position between the Earth and the Sun.
                The planet's thick atmosphere and crushing surface pressure—about 92 times that of Earth's—make
                it an incredibly hostile environment for life as we know it.

            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>
                Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to harbor life. It has a diameter of
                12,742 kilometers and is covered mostly by water, which constitutes about 71% of its surface. Earth's
                climate and life-supporting conditions are maintained by its atmosphere, which is primarily composed
                of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases. The presence of water in its
                three forms—liquid, solid, and vapor—along with the planet's stable temperature range, supports a diverse
                ecosystem. The magnetic field, generated by Earth's molten outer core, protects the planet from harmful
                solar wind and cosmic radiation. This magnetic field also contributes to the creation of the auroras,
                visible near the poles. Earth's plate tectonics play a crucial role in recycling carbon and other
                materials, helping to regulate the planet's climate over long periods. The moon, Earth's only natural
                satellite, influences the tides and stabilizes Earth's axial tilt, which in turn stabilizes its climate.
                Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometers, making it ideal for
                maintaining liquid water—a key ingredient for life. The planet experiences a tilt of approximately
                23.5 degrees, causing seasonal variations in temperature and climate.

            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>
                Mars, often called the "Red Planet," has not only its iron oxide surface but also two small moons,
                Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and may be captured asteroids. Mars' gravity is about
                38% that of Earth's, making the planet a fascinating subject for potential human exploration. The planet
                experiences massive dust storms that can cover its entire surface for days or weeks. Mars also has the
                largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is about three times the height of Mount Everest,
                and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris, which stretches over 4,000 km. Despite its cold temperatures,
                Mars has polar ice caps made of water and frozen carbon dioxide, which grow and recede with the seasons.
                These ice caps, along with signs of past river valleys and lake beds, indicate that Mars likely had a
                wetter, warmer climate billions of years ago, which is why scientists continue to search for signs of
                past life. One of the reasons Mars is now so cold and dry is because its magnetic field weakened
                and eventually disappeared billions of years ago. This left the planet vulnerable to solar wind and
                radiation, which gradually stripped away its atmosphere. Without a strong magnetic field to protect
                it, Mars' once-thicker atmosphere was eroded, reducing its ability to retain heat and water. This loss
                of atmosphere is believed to have contributed to the planet's drastic climate change, transforming it
                from a potentially habitable environment to the barren, hostile one we see today.

            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>
                Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of 139,820 kilometers.
                This gas giant is made mostly of hydrogen and helium and is famous for its Great Red Spot,
                a massive storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic
                field and 92 known moons, including Europa, which is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean beneath
                its icy surface, potentially making it one of the prime candidates for extraterrestrial life in the
                solar system. Additionally, Ganymed, another of Jupiter's moons, is the largest moon in the solar
                system, even larger than the planet Mercury. Jupiter also has a faint ring system, made up mostly
                of dust particles. An important but lesser-known role that Jupiter plays in the solar system
                is acting as a gravitational shield for Earth and other inner planets. Due to its immense size
                and strong gravitational field, Jupiter frequently deflects or captures comets and asteroids that
                might otherwise pose a threat to the inner planets. This protective function reduces the likelihood
                of large impacts on Earth, which could cause significant damage or even mass extinctions. Jupiter’s gravity
                also helps to stabilize the orbits of objects in the asteroid belt, preventing them from colliding with Earth.

            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p>
                Saturn is the second-largest planet and is known for its spectacular ring system,
                made of ice and rock. With a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers, Saturn is primarily
                composed of hydrogen and helium. Saturn, with its 146 known moons, holds the record for
                having the most moons of any planet in our solar system. The most significant of these is
                Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere,
                making it one of the most intriguing celestial bodies for scientific study.

            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>
                Uranus is a gas giant with a diameter of 50,724 kilometers. It is unique in that it rotates
                on its side, with an axial tilt of 98 degrees, likely due to a collision with another large
                object early in its history. Its atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving
                it a pale blue color. It is theorized that on Uranus, under immense pressure and temperature
                deep within the atmosphere, carbon atoms could crystallize into diamonds, which may then rain
                down through the planet's layers. Uranus also has a faint ring system and 28 known moons.

            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <p>
                Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, has a diameter of 49,244 kilometers and is similar
                in composition to Uranus, with methane giving it a striking blue color. Neptune experiences
                the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour.
                It has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of
                Neptune’s rotation, suggesting it was captured by the planet’s gravity.
                Neptune also has a very faint and dark ring system, primarily composed of ice particles mixed with dust.
                Neptune's rings are incomplete, forming arcs rather than full rings, which is unique in the solar system.
